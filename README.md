## #Practice Task of Loop
1. Write a c program to print 8’s time table to 200.
2. Write a c program to print all odd number from 100 to 1.
3. Practice today’s all problem with while loop.
4. Write the differences between break and continue.


### Answer:
1. Go to the > `8s_time_table_to_200.c` file.
2. Go to the > `odd_number_100_1.c` file.
3. Go to the > `more_while_loop.c` file.
4. **Difference between break and continue:**
- `break` - When the condition is met, it completely exits the loop. It stops the entire loop execution.
- `continue` - When the condition is met, it skips the current iteration, and continues with the next one. It doesn’t stop the loop.
